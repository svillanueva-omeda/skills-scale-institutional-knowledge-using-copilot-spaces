# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

## Purpose

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management documentation. This folder serves as the central repository for all process documentation, providing a comprehensive reference for how we plan, execute, and deliver projects at OctoAcme. Whether you're a new team member getting started or an experienced contributor looking for specific process guidance, these documents will help you understand our methodologies, roles, and best practices.

## Project Management Process Overview

OctoAcme follows a structured yet flexible project management approach designed to deliver customer value through iterative, data-informed execution. Our process begins with **project initiation**, where we validate business needs, identify stakeholders, and create a lightweight project one-pager that defines the problem statement, success metrics, and initial timeline. This stage ensures alignment before committing resources and establishes clear decision gates for moving forward.

Once a project is approved, we move into **planning and execution**, breaking work into shippable increments with clear acceptance criteria and Definition of Done. Our teams operate in sprints or iterations, maintaining a prioritized backlog while actively managing dependencies and risks through a structured Risk Register. We emphasize small, frequent releases over large deployments, using pull request workflows with automated testing and peer review to maintain quality. Daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, and regular demos keep the team aligned and stakeholders informed throughout the execution phase.

**Roles and communication** are clearly defined to ensure smooth coordination. Project Managers coordinate delivery, schedules, and risk management; Product Managers define outcomes and prioritize the backlog; Developers implement features with quality and testability in mind; and QA validates acceptance criteria. Communication follows a predictable cadence: twice-weekly standups for delivery teams, weekly PM-PdM syncs, and monthly stakeholder updates, with ad-hoc escalations as needed. This structure maintains transparency while respecting everyone's time.

**Quality assurance and continuous improvement** are embedded throughout our process. We require comprehensive testing including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end smoke tests for critical flows, with security scanning integrated into our CI pipeline. Every release follows a standardized deployment checklist with rollback plans and post-deployment verification. After each sprint, release, or significant milestone, we conduct retrospectives to capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements, fostering a culture of continuous learning and adaptation.
